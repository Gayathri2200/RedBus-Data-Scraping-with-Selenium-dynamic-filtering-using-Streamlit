Project Title: Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium and Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit

Project Description:

This project aims to collect, analyze, and visualize bus travel data from Redbus, a popular online bus ticketing platform. The project uses Selenium for web scraping and Streamlit for data filtering and analysis. The scraped data includes bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability, which is then stored in a structured SQL database. The Streamlit application provides an interactive interface for users to filter and analyze the data based on various parameters such as bus type, route, price range, star rating, and availability.

Key Features:

Data Scraping: Automates the extraction of Redbus data using Selenium. Data Storage: Stores the scraped data in a structured SQL database. Streamlit Application: Develops an interactive Streamlit application for data filtering and analysis. Dynamic Filtering: Implements various filters for users to analyze the data.

Goals:

To collect and store Redbus data in a structured database. To develop an interactive Streamlit application for data filtering and analysis. To provide insights into bus travel trends and patterns.

Methodology:

Data scraping using Selenium. Data storage in a SQL database. Development of a Streamlit application for data filtering and analysis.

Expected Outcomes:

A comprehensive database of Redbus data. An interactive Streamlit application for data filtering and analysis. Insights into bus travel trends and patterns.

Technologies Used:

Python Selenium Streamlit SQL

Industry Relevance:

This project has relevance in the transportation industry, particularly in the bus travel segment. The insights gained from this project can help bus operators, travel agencies, and other stakeholders to make informed decisions about bus routes, schedules, and pricing. Additionally, the project can help to identify trends and patterns in bus travel, which can inform policy decisions and infrastructure development.
